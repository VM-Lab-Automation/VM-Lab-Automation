# Virtual Lab Automation

The subject of the work is automated creation of a virtual environment with all
necessary software needed to complete a laboratory. It includes giving students access
according to specified requirements such as limited time. At the end it also enables the
teacher to download the results of their work. As a result there is the system, which
prepares and provides environments on demand (“as a Service”), described by
templates. The main purpose was delivery of the environment with software for
programmable networks, which was made. However, universality has been provided, so
the solution can be also used to work with other technologies.
The system also provides a scalable architecture, which enables to prepare many
environments simultaneously and responds to the growing necessity of computing power.
Application is also open for development and new functionalities.
The solution is able to play an important role in both remote and classroom teaching.
